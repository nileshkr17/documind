# Big picture / MVP

```
# MVP goal: 
Upload document(s) → ingest (chunk + embed) → store vectors → ask question → return an answer strictly grounded in retrieved chunks + show citations (file + page/section).
Deliverable you can demo: a single-page UI showing upload, a chat box, answer with citations, and a downloadable README + Docker Compose to run locally.
